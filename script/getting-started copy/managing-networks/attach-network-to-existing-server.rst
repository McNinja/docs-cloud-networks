Attach your network to an existing server
=========================================

You can attach your network to existing servers by using the
Nova-Network API. The Neutron API does not provide an equivalent
operation. See the `Cloud Servers Getting Started Guide Virtual
Interfaces <http://docs.rackspace.com/servers/api/v2/cs-gettingstarted/content/nova_summary_virtualints.html>`__
for examples of attaching a network to an existing server by using the
Nova-Network API and the Cloud Networks virtual interface extension
