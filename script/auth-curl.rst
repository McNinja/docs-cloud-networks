.. _auth-curl:

Authenticate with cURL
----------------------

To authenticate with cURL, issue a **POST /tokens** request to the appropriate Rackspace 
Cloud Identity Service endpoint.

In the request body, supply one of the following sets of credentials:

-  User name and password

-  User name and API key

Your user name and password are the ones that you use to log in to the Rackspace Cloud 
Control Panel.

..  note::

    If you authenticate with username and password credentials, you can use multi-factor 
    authentication to add an additional level of account security. This feature is not 
    implemented for username and API credentials. For more information, see 
    :rax-devdocs:`multi-factor authentication <cloud-identity/v2/developer-guide/#document-authentication-info/use-mfa-ops>` 
    in the *Cloud Identity Client Developer Guide*.

To find your API key, perform the following steps:

#. Log in to the :mycloud:`Cloud Control Panel<>`.

#. On the upper-right side of the top navigation pane, click your username.

#. From the menu, select Account Settings.

#. In the Login Details section of the Account Settings page, locate the API Key field and 
   click Show.

**To authenticate with cURL:**

#. Get an authentication token and a service catalog with a list of endpoints.

   Use one of the following cURL commands to authenticate to the Identity endpoint:
 
   **Example: Authenticate with username and password: JSON request**

   .. code::  

       $ curl -s https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/tokens -X 'POST' \
              -d '{"auth":{"passwordCredentials":{"username":"yourUserName", "password":"yourPassword"}}}' \
              -H "Content-Type: application/json" | python -m json.tool
    
   **Example: Authenticate with username and API key: JSON request**

   .. code::  

       $ curl -s https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/tokens -X 'POST' \
              -d '{"auth":{"RAX-KSKEY:apiKeyCredentials":{"username":"yourUserName", "apiKey":"yourApiKey"}}}' \
              -H "Content-Type: application/json" | python -m json.tool


   In response to valid credentials, your request returns an authentication token and a 
   service catalog with the endpoints that you need to request services.

   ..  note:: 
        
       If you authenticated with username and password credentials, and the Identity service 
       returns a 401 message requesting additional credentials, your account is configured 
       for :rax-devdocs:`multi-factor authentication <cloud-identity/v2/developer-guide/#document-authentication-info/use-mfa-ops>`. 
        
       To complete the authentication process, submit a second POST tokens request with 
       multi-factor authentication credentials.
       
   Do not include explicit API endpoints in your scripts and applications. Instead, find 
   the endpoint for your service and region.

   The following output shows a partial authentication response in JSON format:

   **Example: Authentication: JSON response**

   .. code::

               "serviceCatalog": [

   Successful authentication returns the following information:

   **Endpoints to request Rackspace Cloud services**. Appears in the
   ``endpoints`` element in the ``serviceCatalog`` element.

   - Endpoint information includes the public URL, which is the endpoint that you use to 
     access the service, as well as region, tenant ID, and version information.
        
   **Tenant ID**. Appears in the ``tenantId`` field in the ``endpoints``
   element. The tenant ID is also known as the account number.

   - You include the tenant ID in the endpoint URL when you call a cloud service.

   **The name of the service**. Appears in the ``name`` field.
   
   - To access the Cloud Networks service, locate and use the ``publicURL`` value 
     for the ``cloudNetworks`` service.

   - The service might show multiple endpoints to enable regional
     choice. Select the appropriate endpoint for the region that you want
     to interact with by examining the ``region`` field.

     .. tip:: To help you decide which regionalized endpoint to use, read about
        :kc-article:`special considerations<about-regions>` for choosing a data center.

   **Expiration date and time for authentication token**. Appears in the
   ``expires`` field in the ``token`` element.

   - After this date and time, the token is no longer valid. This field predicts the maximum 
     lifespan for a token, but does not guarantee that the token reaches that lifespan.

   - Clients are encouraged to cache a token until it expires.

   - Because the authentication token expires after 24 hours, you must generate a token once a day.

   **Authentication token**. Appears in the ``id`` field in the ``token`` element.

   - You pass the authentication token in the ``X-Auth-Token`` header each
     time that you send a request to a service.


#. Copy the values in the ``publicURL`` and ``tenantId`` fields for the 
   ``cloudNetworks`` service for your region, and copy the authentication token from 
   the ``id`` field in the ``token`` element.
